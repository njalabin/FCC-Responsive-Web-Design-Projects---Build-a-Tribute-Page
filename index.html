      <p class="text-content">Howard Joel Wolowitz is a fictional character on the
         CBS television series The Big Bang Theory, portrayed by actor Simon Helberg. Howard is the only starring character who has been to the International Space
         Station.</p>
      <p class="text-content">Here are some trivia about him:</p>
        <ul class="text-content">
          <li>Howard is allergic to nuts, particularly peanuts and pistachios;
            they can induce a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction in him,
            which has a side effect of disfiguring his face horribly. He once
            deliberately caused this reaction by eating a granola bar to keep
            Leonard busy at the hospital when they were planning a surprise
            birthday party for him.</li>
          <li>Besides English, Howard can speak seven languages including French,
            Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, Persian, Japanese, and the constructed
            language Klingon from the Star Trek franchise. He also knows some
            words in Sindarin, one of the elvish dialects invented by J.R.R.
            Tolkien for The Lord of the Rings.</li>
          <li>Howard developed a robotic arm for the International Space Station.
            Realizing how much it felt like an actual arm, he used the arm for
            masturbation, only to get the arm stuck on his penis. He called
            Leonard and Raj, but neither was willing to get too "hands on" and
            help free him from the arm's grip.</li>
          <li>Although Jewish, Howard is not very serious about his religion, and
            does not keep kosher. For instance, he eats pork, and when the price
            of pork went up at the group's favorite Chinese restaurant, he
            remarked "it's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew".</li>
        </ul>

        ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with a pepper spray."
